# RSA Encryption/Decryption Streamlit App üõ°Ô∏èüîê

## Overview
This Streamlit web application provides an interactive platform for demonstrating the RSA encryption and decryption processes, and how it could be utilized in the cloud. Developed for the Bil443 Cryptography and Security class, the app allows users to upload files, encrypt or decrypt them using RSA algorithm, and download the processed files. It's a practical showcase of cryptographic principles in Cloud Systems.

## Features
- **RSA Key Generation**: Generate RSA keys based on user-provided prime numbers.
- **File Encryption**: Encrypt text files using the RSA public key.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt files using the RSA private key.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use, with clear instructions and feedback.

## Usage
1. Enter two distinct prime numbers to generate RSA keys.
2. In the Encryption section, upload a text file and click 'Encrypt' to encrypt the file.
3. In the Decryption section, upload an encrypted file and click 'Decrypt' to decrypt it.
4. Download the encrypted or decrypted file as needed.

## Technical Details
- **main.py**: The main script for the Streamlit web app interface.
- **rsa.py**: Contains the RSA algorithm implementation for encryption and decryption.

## Acknowledgments
A heartfelt thank you to my professor in the Bil443 Cryptography and Security class for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. üôè
